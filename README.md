## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
  - A lightweight Python web framework that makes it easy to develop APIs and web applications.
  
- **Database:** SQLite3
  - SQLite3 is used for local, lightweight database management. It will store user health data, preferences, and AI-generated recommendations.

- **Frontend:** HTML and CSS
  - Simple, clean HTML and CSS will be used to build the user interface. Future enhancements could include JavaScript and front-end frameworks like React or Vue.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SarveshwarSenthilKumar/Vitalisync.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Vitalisync
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


5. Set up the databases by running each of the following scripts:
   ```bash
   python createDatabase.py
   ```

6. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to access the app.

## Flask Development Template
For this project, I used the **[Flask Development Template](https://github.com/SarveshwarSenthilKumar/Flask-Development-Template)** as the base template for building the backend. The template provides a solid foundation for developing Flask applications with best practices, including structure for routing, database handling, and integration with various extensions like Flask-Migrate for database migrations.

## Future Enhancements

- **Telehealth Integration:** Connect users with virtual health professionals.
- **Fitness Challenges:** Encourage healthy habits through social engagement.
- **Expanded Wearable Integration:** Support for more health tracking devices.
- **Mobile App Development:** Create mobile applications for better accessibility.
